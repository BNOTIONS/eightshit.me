# Eightshit.me !!!!

This was built extremely quickly and there are a lot of things I would recommend changing if you're gonna do something with this, but it is neat!

I haven't really looked through the source in a long time either so I don't really want to point out everything that's dumb, but I think there is some messy crap as far as authentication goes, and the database design isn't super great (image paths are stored in the same table as users, etc) Also most of the DB interaction is happening in controllers instead of models which is gross too

All the stuff labelled 'god' is actually the admin stuff.

There also may be stupid/bad words in the comments, but the site is called eightshit anyway

Other libraries used here:
* [Kohana 3.1](http://kohanaframework.org) (You'll especially want to get familiar with this one and its Auth module)
* [Tijs Verkoyen's Twitter Library](http://classes.verkoyen.eu/twitter/)
* [SWFObject](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/) to embed the drawing app
 
Cool, have fun and be great,
